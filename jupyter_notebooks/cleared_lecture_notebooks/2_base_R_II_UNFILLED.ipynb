    "Error handling is an important aspect of programming that allows you to manage and respond to errors in a controlled way. In R, you can use functions like `try()` and `tryCatch()` to handle errors. These are very useful to use in loops or apply functions, when your concerned some observations may cause an error but you'd like your code to attempt all iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **try()**: This function allows you to run a piece of code and catch any errors that occur.\n",
    "    - It returns the result of the code if it runs successfully, or an error object if an error occurs.\n",
    "    - By returning an error object, your able to keep moving forward.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to handle errors for now (the less technical way)\n",
    "\n",
    "While we won't go into detailed examples here, it's important to be aware of these functions and how they can be used to make your code more robust and error-tolerant.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a beginner programmer, encountering errors is a common and essential part of the learning process. Here are some strategies to effectively address errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**:\n",
    "    - Error messages often provide valuable information about what went wrong and where. Take the time to read and understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Google the Error**:\n",
    "    - Copy and paste the error message into a search engine. Often, you will find forums, blog posts, or documentation that address similar issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Stack Overflow**:\n",
    "    - Stack Overflow is a popular platform where developers ask and answer programming questions. Search for your error or ask a new question if you can't find a solution. Be sure to provide a clear and concise description of your problem, including relevant code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consult Documentation**:\n",
    "    - Official documentation for the programming language or library you are using can be very helpful. It often includes examples and explanations of common errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cautiously Leverage AI Tools**:\n",
    "    - AI tools like ChatGPT can provide code suggestions and help identify potential issues in your code. These tools can be particularly useful for beginners who are still learning the syntax and best practices.\n",
    "    - However, be **very careful** to not use these resources as a crutch. If you depend on them too much, you will miss the opportunity to learn how to code for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Ask for Help**:\n",
    "    - Don't hesitate to ask for help from more experienced programmers, whether they are colleagues, mentors, or members of online communities. Providing a clear explanation of your problem and what you have tried so far will increase your chances of getting useful assistance and is a good exercise in identifying your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Practice Debugging**:\n",
    "    - Debugging is a skill that improves with practice.\n",
    "    - It sometimes feels like suffering, but you will become a better programming by struggling through your own errors. \n",
