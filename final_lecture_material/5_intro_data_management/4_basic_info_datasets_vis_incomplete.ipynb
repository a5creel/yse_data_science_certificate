    "# Reading in a Dataset and Gathering Basic Information\n",
    " In this lecture, we will cover how to read in CSV data. CSVs store tabular data organized in rows and columns where, typically, each row is an observation and each column is a variable that you collected data on. The data frames that we've been building from scratch in lectures preceeding this one are in a tabular format.\n",
    " \n",
    " There are other common types of files:\n",
    " - Excel files (which are also tabular data)\n",
    " - Shapefiles (for geographic and spatial data)\n",
    " - Columnar files (similar to tabular data but more effiecent to store)\n",
    " \n",
    " These other files that can easily be worked with in R or Python. We will revist these file types later in this course. \n",
    " \n",
    " Today, after we read in our CSV, we will gather basic information about the dataset.  We will also discuss basic functions for inspecting dataset properties, dimensions, data types, and summary statistics. Additionally, we will introduce read-write functions, discuss the cost of holding data in RAM, checking resource allocation, and explore lazy load options. Finally, we will touch on the basics of data visualization.\n",

    "Sometimes, datasets are too large to fit into the working memory of your computer. In such cases, loading the entire dataset at once can be impractical or impossible. This is where load dataset functions come in handy. These functions allow you to read in data in chunks or use lazy loading techniques, which means that data is only read into memory when it is actually needed. This approach helps in managing memory usage efficiently and enables you to work with large datasets without running into memory issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be discussed in detail later in the class. But it's worth being aware that your computer has working memory constraints. There are packages out there specifically designed to get around this. For example, the arrow package in R allows you to work with large datasets efficiently by enabling you to `filter()` data and `select()` variables before loading it into memory. This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets that do not fit into memory. You can use the `open_dataset()` function from `arrow` to open a dataset and apply filters before reading it into memory. This function supports various file formats, including CSV, Parquet (columnar), and Feather.\n",
