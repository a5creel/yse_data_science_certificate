# Overview
In this Git repo, I develop 6 lectures for the YSE Data Science Certificate team. Below, I outline the lecture material. 

In these lectures, students begin analyzing data in R and then Python. A PDF of the lecture material accompanies each lecture so students can review it before. An incomplete notebook is provided so for them to syncronously write it during recorded lectures. A complete notebook is provided for reference. All examples are environmentally themed, as well as the problem sets. 

These 6 lectures should included in the Foundations section of the certificate. I have a GitHub lecture may fit better in another section of the certificate.
