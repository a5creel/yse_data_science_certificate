# Overview
In this Git repo, I develop 9 lectures (six topics) for the YSE Data Science Certificate team. Below, I outline the lecture material. 

In these lectures, students begin analyzing data in R and Python and learn how to organize their programming projects using R Projects and GitHub Repositories. A PDF of the lecture material accompanies each lecture so students can review it before, follow along during, and revisit the material later. I also have three problem sets that accompany these six topics. All examples are environmentally themed, as well as the problem sets. 

The first eight of these lectures should included in the Foundations section of the certificate. The GitHub lecture may fit better with project management material. 

Last January, I taught a version of lectures over a three-day programming workshop to ~20 students. The workshop received a 4.7/5 review (from the 16 students who completed the feedback form). Students highlighted the lecture notes and problem sets as helpful for learning the material. I am offering this workshop again in January 2025.

# to dos 

- mention in data vis lecture they'll learn more later 
- change repo they clone in github lecture 
- Edit problem sets
